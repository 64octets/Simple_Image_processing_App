# Simple Matlab Image Processing Application
The following repository contains a simple image processing app which you may run on Matlab using the gui_test2.m code and the corresponding design code is provided in gui_test2.fig.

## Visit My website - .... to download a stand alone version of the above application

```
The code in this repository has the source code for the implementaion of the Image Processing app in the above image.
Feel free to edit the functions as you wish.
```

## Some guidelines to create the GUI
```

Install Matlab and Matlab GUIDE for making simple Matlab GUI
Install Matlab Image processing toolbox
Type guide in the command prompt. This will create your .fig file which is the GUI design.
In the UI drag and drop elements as needed
Make sure to have atleast one Axes element (this is your display)
Add buttons as you wish
Activate the Axes element first by right clicking that object in your .fig file -> ViewCallBacks -> Create Fcn
Next you can code for any functionality of the buttons using the same right click -> ViewCallBacks -> Callbacks 


```
